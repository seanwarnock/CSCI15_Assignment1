Write a program, broken into functions as specified below, to read the coefficients of a series of quadratic equations from a text file and print the associated roots (or appropriate error messages if there are no real roots) to another text file.  The coefficients of a quadratic are the a, b and c of an expression of the form ax2 + bx + c, and the roots are the values of x that make the value of the expression 0.  The roots are given by this formula:
